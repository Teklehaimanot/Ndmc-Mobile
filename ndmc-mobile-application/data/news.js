      "The prominent journal publishing different issues on health and medical affairs, Nature Medicine, invited Dr. Lia Taddesse (Minister, MOH) to publish a perspective on the relevance of investing in health data to foster economic growth in low and middle-income countries. Content-wise, the article has addressed major issues related to data use in the health dynamics of low and middle-income countries. Above all, however, Ethiopia’s experience of managing and using health data for informed decision-making has been made a flagship all the way through. This has been shown by the astonishing jobs done by the collaborative project of IHME-EPHI on the subnational burden of disease estimation. More specifically, the activities conducted by the offspring of the collaboration, the National Data Management and Analytics Centre for Health at EPHI, have been put exemplary in archiving, analyzing, and interpreting data for informed decision-making. Finally, she has forwarded some remarks on how to improve data management practices in low and middle-income countries. Find the complete article with the link below.",

      "The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) offered training on the sub-national burden of disease estimation on August 31 and September 1, 2022, at Raddison BLU hotel, Addis Ababa. The National Data Management Center for Health (NDMC) took the role of organizing the training; the whole training aimed to capacitate staff members of MOH, EPHI, GBD collaborators, researchers from universities, and representatives of Health and Demographic Surveillance sites (HDSS), officers from regional public health institutes and regional health bureaus on the sub-national burden of disease estimation. In the technical sense, it focused on estimating the burden and distribution of diseases in small areas. In that regard, demographics, causes of death, non-fatal health outcomes, risk factors, and policy applications were the areas given the emphasis in the training. By far, the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) has provided tools to quantify health loss from hundreds of diseases, injuries, and risk factors. The aim of doing so is to improve health systems and eliminate disparities.",

Apart from that, Ethiopia’s  Minister of Health, Dr. Lia Taddese is the senior author of the study with Prof. Christopher Murray of IHME. States Ministers, along with, researchers and higher officials from the Ethiopian Public Health Institute, IHME, GBD collaborators, and different institutions have co-authored the study.${"\n"}In the technical sense, the study was part of the collaborative work between EPHI and IHME as part of the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019, and it was funded by Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. To this day, the study can be considered as the first of its kind in identifying the major improvements and pitfalls of Ethiopia’s health sector over the last three decades. To do so, it applied data from all available data sources, and come up with tangible findings, policy recommendations, and a call to action.${"\n"}The major findings of the study have shown that Ethiopia has made substantial improvements in health over the last three decades. First, it is noted that the socio-demographic index has steadily increased in all regions and cities since 1990. Except for the Somali region, there were substantial declines in total fertility rates among all regions. Second, life expectancy improved across the subnational states from 1990 to 2019, and inequality in life expectancy across the regions is decreasing despite increasing socio-demographic index disparities. Along with that, the study shows the declines in causes of premature mortality among the different regions of the country.`,

The health atlas, produced by NDMC, appears to be the first of its kind in the health system of Ethiopia. Given the name ‘National and Regional Health Atlas’, the document is produced from the national and subnational burden of disease analysis in Ethiopia. Under the Ministry of Health’s leadership, the National Data Management Centre for Health at EPHI and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington have collaboratively been working to produce a comparable national and subnational burden of disease results from 1990 to 2019. Granted that, the atlas presents the burden of diseases between the years 1990-2019, it is highlighted that the Ministry of Health, as well as, the regional health bureaus of Ethiopia will benefit in making informed decisions. Through the entire route of preparing the document, the IHME offered technical support, and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation provided financial support.${"\n"}The second document presented was a guideline on health data access and sharing, which was prepared by NDMC and PPMED and experts from different institutions have participated in the preparation of the document. Again, it has been stressed that this guideline is the first document prepared to govern issues related to health data access and sharing in Ethiopia.${"\n"}Overall, keynote speeches, presentations, and discussions were the major activities at the event. In that regard, Dr. Ruth Nigatu, a delegate of the minster and chief of staff at the minister’s office, was the guest of honor and keynote speaker.
